h2. Manual invocation of tests

<a href="{relocatable: test-format.html}">Test scripts</a> in
Inquisitor are normal executable Unix shell scripts. While usually
they are run with <a href="{relocatable: scheduler.html}">scheduler</a>
automatically, it's quite easy to run any test manually, supplying
required test parameters.

The most basic way to run tests is just to enter its name; however,
test scripts are usually outside of user's @PATH@, so it's necessary
to use full path to script, such as @/usr/share/inquisitor/test/@, for
example:

<pre>/usr/share/inquisitor/test/stress-compress</pre>

Alternatively, one can add test's directory to @PATH@ and just run
test by its name, although it's not recommended:

<pre>
export PATH=/usr/share/inquisitor/test:$PATH
stress-compress
</pre>

This command launches <a href="{relocatable:
tests/stress-compress.html}">stress-compress</a> test. Test will
present a text user interface with editable test parameter fields, for
example:

<img src="{relocatable: manual-invocation-tui.png}" width="568" height="408" alt="Text user interface with test parameters" />

Tests automatically support basic GNU options. One can check version
and copyright info with @-V@ / @--version@:

<pre>
Inquisitor test: Stress compression
Test's version: 0.1
A part of Inquisitor platform, version {include_file: {filename: src/version.txt}}

</pre>

One can invoke test with @-h@ / @--help@ to displaying help on all the
supported test parameters, for example:

<pre>
Inquisitor test: Stress compression
A part of Inquisitor platform, version {include_file: {filename: src/version.txt}}

This test runs many jobs on a hard drive simultaneously with background
syncer. Each jobs performs compression/decompression together with
taring/untaring of a big archive (Linux source code for example) in
infinite loop. Syncer simply makes sync call each specified number of
seconds. After specified time amount passed all jobs will be killed with
syncer. Test will post benchmark results and successfully finish.

Usage: [variables] /usr/share/inquisitor/test/stress-compress [options]

Options:
  -h, --help            display this help and exit
  -V, --version         output version information and exit

Variables:
  TESTTIME              Total time of stress testing, sec (600)
  STRESS_TREE           Gzipped tarball file containing stress test tree (stress.tar.gz)
  JOBS                  Number of parallely running jobs during stress test (16)
  SYNCTIME              Sync time period, sec (8)

WARNING! This test would destroy the contents of all your hard drives!
</pre>

It's possible to pre-enter some or all of the test parameters as normal shell
variables, for example:

<pre>
TESTTIME=900 JOBS=2 /usr/share/inquisitor/test/stress-compress
</pre>

Note that it will still display text user inteface and require
confirmation(s) to start. If one wants to completely automatize test
running, it's better to <a href="{relocatable: scheduler.html}">run
tests using a scheduler</a>.
