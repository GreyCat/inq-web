Full-fledged Inquisitor is still not quite ready, but we'd like to
release parts of it that could already prove themselves useful. Today's
release is *<a href="{relocatable:/doc/einarc/}">Einarc</a>*. Einarc is a
subproject of Inquisitor that provides unified interface to all
proprietary RAID (storage) controllers.
