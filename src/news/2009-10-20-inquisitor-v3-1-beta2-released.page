We're pleased to announce the second beta release of Inquisitor v3.1
Live CD. This is experimental build made with Debian package base.

This is a bugfix release that fixes numerous bugs, stability and
usability issues in previous alpha and beta releases.

We welcome all users who want to get the latest Inquisitor build to
download it and try. Platform v3.1 really looks and acts better than
dated v3.0 in many cases.
