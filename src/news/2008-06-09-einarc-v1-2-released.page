After a half of year development cycle, new version of Einarc gets
released today.

<a href="{relocatable:/doc/einarc/}">Einarc</a> is a subproject of
Inquisitor that provides unified interface to all proprietary RAID
(storage) controllers. 

h3. What's new

* Support for new RAID devices: newer Adaptec adapters using *arcconf*.

* New objects "bbu" and "firmware" are introduced: now it's possible to
get information about BBU and read/write firmware to supported adapters.

* More strict "adapter info" report: it outputs serial number and tries
to pinpoint a particular adapter using PCI IDs, if possible.

* Updates for existing devices:
** *aaccli*: now it downloads and uses later, more acceptable version,
not linked against arts library. Note, however, that
Adaptec_Storage_Manager-Linux_v2.10.00 is a huge ~36M download.
** *areca*: update to v1.80A_71012.
** *megacli*: updated to v1.01.27.

* Multiple stability, metadata and rare occurance fixes for all modules.

* Improved build system.

* "raid-wizard-passthrough" can be used to handle smaller groups of
HDDs (not all available devices).
