Release candidate of a new version of Einarc, a subproject of
Inquisitor that provides unified interface to all proprietary RAID
(storage) controllers, announced today.

Focus points that would be fully represented in final release:

* Support for post-build reconfiguration of proprietary CLIs and
supporting modules. This allows Einarc to be supplied via usual binary
packaging methods (rpm/deb): proprietary CLIs can be installed after
binary package installation using special setup tool "einarc-install".

* Experimental support for hardware RAID autodetection in both
build-time (configure) and run-time (einarc-install).

* Many stability fixes and bug fixes.
