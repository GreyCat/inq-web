Einarc, a subproject of Inquisitor that provides unified interface to
all proprietary RAID (storage) controllers, gets a long-awaited
facelift.

* Support for 3ware / AMCC controllers by Andras Horvath.

* Full read/write support of Linux software RAIDs.

* Updated all proprietary utilities URLs, pumped up version numbers,
fixed wrapper regular expressions to support new versions of CLIs.

* Added new calculated fields in adapter_info: PCI product/subproduct
and vendor/subvendor IDs. These allow precise identification of PCI
devices related to adapters shown by Einarc.

* Fuller BBU support for Adaptec adapters.

* Multiple stability and build fixes (Makefile now supports parallel
execution with "make -j").
