Inquisitor team is pleased to announce Inquisitor v3.0 - a first major
open-source version of the platform. After initial announcement of
Inquisitor branch 3.x in August 2007, it's a fruit of almost a year of
labor.

Inquisitor version 3 is a major redesign of older 1.x and 2.x systems.
New features:

* Modularity: it consists of dozens of interconnected and
interchangeable modules with well-defined API; one can easily add new
modules to add new tests, detections, production steps, etc.

* Three varieties: standalone (runs on top of already installed OS),
live CD (can be used to analyse/test just one home computer), enterprise
(server-controller network boot).

* Flexibility: every test parameter can be adjusted, all system can be
customized.

* Server-controlled testing: server-based version includes a database
that stores all the data on all computers that were tested by
Inquisitor. If only some parts of hardware will change, clever scheduler
wonâ€™t redo all the long testing, but only tests relevant to hardware
changes.

* Distributed workload: due to modular architecture, Inquisitor can be
easily distributed across a cluster to distribute load or make a
geographically distributed system.

For those who would like to try Inquisitor, the easiest way is to download
a 130MB ISO, available for both x86 and x86_64 from http://www.inquisitor.ru/.

Comments and especially bug reports are welcome.
