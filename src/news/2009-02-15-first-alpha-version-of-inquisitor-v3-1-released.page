We're pleased to announce first public alpha release on brand new
Inquisitor v3.1 Live CD. This is experimental build made with Debian
package base.

Overview of new features in this Live CD build over 3.0 platform
release:

* Lots of improvements in Live CD: profiles at Live CD are also
XML-based now, so they can be easily replaced/interchanged. Profiles
can include each other. Live CD interface received major facelift to
allow more control over testing process (including, for example,
infinite testing).
* Throughout support for new client platform: Debian (including builds
of Enterprise and Live CD versions).
* New class of modules - "software detects" are introduced. These
modules detect and record versions and build options of software used
for future reference.
* Lots of new tests: array-configurator, bonnie++ version 0.2,
boot_from_image, db_comparison_fast, dd, hdd-passthrough version 0.3,
iozone, mencoder_hdd, mencoder_memory, partimage, stress-compress,
torrent-upload.
* New hardware detects: Infiniband, BBU.
* New monitorings: loadavg.

Lots of stability fixes and bug fixes were applied:

* This release uses new version of Einarc (one-that-would-be-1.4) to
manage hardware and software RAIDs on storage devices.
* Heavily improved new hdd-badblocks utility.
* Fixed many issues with XML indentation and compliance on client and
server sides.
* Many user interface and general outlook improvements.

API extensions:

* A hook that allows unconditional execution of code after test
competion (like "finally").
* Enhanced helper API for tests and detects in client's API.
* Firmware test heavily uses hardware detects.
* Benchmarks can publish measurement units.
* Ability to change default filesystem used in many tests.
