LiveCD builds.

h3. New features

* Added new flavour: "standalone". Inquisitor Standalone is packaged in
normal rpm/dpkg to be installed and ran in normal running system. It is
limited in functionality, but can be used to demonstrate Inquisitor
principles well.

* Added monitorings API, server-side support and graphing support and one
sample client-side monitoring: hdd-smart.

* New detects: BMCs, tape drives.

computers ("what was required by documents" vs "what hardware is really
there"), "offline" firmware flashing.

disk life) fixes in usb-flash-drive, skip virtual drives in HDD tests.

computers under test, starting a new testing always sets a profile for
