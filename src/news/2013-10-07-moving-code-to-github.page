All repositories are converted from Subversion to Git and moved to GitHub.

After a long discussion, finally, Inquisitor project is ready to
present new structure for its multiple repositories. All code base,
documentation and web site were converted from Subversion to Git and are
available at GitHub now:

* <a href="https://github.com/inq-team/inq">Main Inquisitor code repository</a>, includes client, server and build system.
* <a href="https://github.com/inq-team/inq-web/">Inquisitor web site repository</a>, includes web site sources and official documentation.
* <a href="https://github.com/inq-team/einarc">Einarc subproject</a>, a storage management API & CLI

We invite you to check them out and feel free to use new opportunities
provided by GitHub, such as pull requests.
