Inquisitor project made an entry in <a href="http://wiki.debian.org/Derivatives/Census">Debian Census</a>
initiative.

The Debian derivatives census is an attempt to gather information
about Debian derivatives that is useful to Debian, for integration of
that information into Debian infrastructure and for the development
of relationships between Debian and our derivatives.

For more information, see <a href="http://www.debian.org/News/2011/20110124">official Debian derivatives census announce</a>.
