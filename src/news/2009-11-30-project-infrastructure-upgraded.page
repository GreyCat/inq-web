We've made a couple of adjustments that would benefit the project in
long term.

* <a href="{relocatable:/forum.page}">Official Inquisitor forums</a> (gated with
mailing lists) using Nabble embedded forum service should make it
easier for some users to communicate.

* <a href="http://github.com/gvy/inq">Inquisitor git mirrored repository at github</a>
simplifies collaboration on Inquisitor for git users.

* Updated contact form with captcha.
